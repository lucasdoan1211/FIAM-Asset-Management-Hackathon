FIAM Asset Management Hackathon

Overview

This repository contains the work developed for the FIAM Asset Management Hackathon held in Montreal, Canada (Sept 2024 â€“ Oct 2024). The project focuses on leveraging deep learning and advanced machine learning techniques to analyze large-scale financial data and enhance predictive accuracy for investment strategies.

Project Goals

Develop a deep learning-based financial model by performing extensive data preprocessing, feature selection, and data analysis.

Identify top 25% highly correlated features from big financial data spanning 2000-2023.

Improve predictive accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and optimization.

Develop mixed buy-sell investment strategies for 100 stocks, enhancing fund performance evaluation.

Key Features
